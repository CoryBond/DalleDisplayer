# üç± DalleDisplayer

DalleDisplayer is a program originally designed for a single board computer (a raspberry pi 3 specifically) that displays Dalle Images to a connected screen. It is planned to support voice commands, touch screens and remote commands. These will all be incremental features!

This is a side project I am working on as I upgraded my retropie gaming system to the new raspbery pi 5 and want to do a cool project with my old raspberry pi 3. In particular I am interested in doing something AI related as the latest developments in AI tools (like ChatGPT 4) seem to have lots of pratical utility in peoples lives. Setting aside the controversies arising from AI tools I want to get more involved in developing with them both for my job and for fun.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

1. Run a python GUI on a monitor [‚úÖ]
2. Create a git repo for the project [‚úÖ]
3. Boot the DalleDisplayer GUI on device start [‚úÖ]
4. Connect 7 inch touchscreen display to the pi [‚úÖ]
5. Boot GUI to connected touchscreen [‚úÖ]
6. Wire the touchscreen to the board [‚úÖ]
7. Install the Dalle Python client. [‚úÖ]
8. Pay for a client subscription. [‚úÖ]
9. Display Dalle Images to screen via hardcoded prompts.
10. Connect usb microphone to the device (might be more difficult then it ... sounds) [‚úÖ]
11. Support voice commands when a user touches a "make image" button.

## Running The Program

This project was built in Python3.9 on a Raspberry Pi 3 with a arm7 (32 bit) chipset. Python 3.9 is the default version used by the Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm.
Its recommended to make a virtual python env with `Python3.9 -m env myenv`. Activate this virtual environment, install all necessary packages and run the entry file in `src/main.py`

## üè¥Û†Å∂Û†Å•Û†Å∑Û†Åø Dependencies

Almost all python packages required by this project can be found in the requirements.txt and can be imported into a python environment using:
`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` after starting your pytho env `source myenv/bin/activate`.

### Additional Package Installs

Some packages, like speech_recognition, also require additional system specific packages if they don't already exist. You might have to install
these manually prior to using DalleDisplayer.
For example:

| System | Package | Install Command                      | Required By        |
| ------ | ------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
 sudo apt-get install qtvirtualkeyboard-plugin
 qml-module-qtquick-controls
 qml-module-qtquick-layouts
 qml-module-qt-labs-folderlistmodel

| Linux  | PYQT5   | sudo apt install python3-pyqt5       | pyqt5              |
| Linx   | tKinter | sudo apt-get install python3-tk      | tKinter            |
| Linx   | tKinterImage | sudo apt-get install python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk      | tKinter            |
| Linx   | PyAudio | sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio | pyaudio            |
| Linx   | Flac    | sudo apt-get install flac            | speech_recognition |
| Linx   | ESpeak  | sudo apt-get install espeak          | speech_recognition |


### PiWheels

Newer versions of packages, specifically numpy, can take absurd amounts of time to compile and download on a rasbperry pi. To avoid this only use the numpy version specified in the requirements file and setup pre-compiled pi [wheels](https://www.piwheels.org/) installations in the `etc/pip.config`.

## üì∂ How to display GUI through SSH / Remote VSCode

If on a windows machine and you want to display this GUI back through SSH to the client then do the following:

1. Install and run https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/
2. Make sure the SSH session uses ForwardX11 :
3. The following configs in VSCode can be set : -ForwardAgent yes -ForwardX11 yes -ForwardX11Trusted yes

And this should make it work!

## üñ•Ô∏è How to display GUI on connected monitor

Dalle Displayer can run in either Desktop Environments or in Window Manger environments though the later will require some extra work to setup.

### No Desktop Environment

Before you can display this program onto a connected monitor you must first setup a display server and window manager for the GUI. Assuming you work in a headless environment you can use xinit + openbox for this as follows:

1. Install xinit openbox
   (NOTE: [xinit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinit) is display server while [openbox]() is a graphical window manager. Together these will allow rendering the python GUI to a connected monitor. )
2. Create a directory/file called at `~/.config/openbox/autostart`
   1. Add an entry in that file as ` ~path_to_DalleDisplayer_root~/myenv/bin/python ~path_to_DalleDisplayer_root~/src/main.py` (autostart runs everytime the openbox-session [not the openbox command line] runs)

After following these steps you can now run `xinit openbox-session` and it will should start up the DalleDisplayer and render the GUI to the connected monitor.
If the DalleDisplayer closes while openbox-session is still up you can do a few things to restart it:

1. Restart xinit + openbox
2. Run the script directly while openbox session is open with `DISPLAY=:0.0 python3 ~path_to_DalleDisplayer_root~/src/main.py`

#### Boot

Several linux tools allow xinit + openbox + DalleDisplayer to start at boot though I recommend using crontab. Using rc.local to load startx did not cause openbox to detect the user specific `~/.config/openbox/autostart`` script.

After opening `crontab -e` all you need to do is add a line like `@reboot xinit openbox-session`. If you also setup DalleDisplayer in the openbox autostart file then it will load at boot as well.

#### Script

This project also includes a script that does the following:

1. Kill openbox instances that would be running the displayer (this will also kill entire openbox sessions!)
2. Restart openbox specificlaly opening only this python application.

Simply run the script with `startx ./tools/openBoxStarter.bash`.

#### Calibrating Touchscreen

For touchscreens its possible for the input to off.... sometimes very off. In a headless environment there is a tool
that uses xinit to recalibrate the input. Simply install [xinput_calibrator](xinput_calibrator) and run it with `startx`

## Tests

There is included a test package of pytests for various functions and classes used throughout the project. 

There exists a test UI which uses mock APIs rather then real ones for dev purposes. Simply run the application in this mode run the openbox script with the t flag (ex: `startx ./tools/openBoxStarter.bash -t`)










## SCRAP

tkinker doesn't support touch gestures though there is a draft for it : https://core.tcl-lang.org/tips/doc/trunk/tip/570.md
